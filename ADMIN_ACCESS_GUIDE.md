## 🎯 Currency Enforcement System Overview

### How It Works

1. **User Registration**
   - IP geolocation detects user's country
   - System assigns currency: 🇨🇦 Canada → CAD, 🇺🇸 USA → USD
   - If confidence is high (≥70%) → Currency locked

2. **Currency Lock**
   - User cannot change currency in profile settings
   - Auction creation pre-fills enforced currency
   - System shows 🔒 badge and compliance message

3. **Appeal Process**
   - User sees "Request Currency Change" button
   - Submits appeal with reason and proof
   - Admin reviews and approves/rejects
   - If approved → Currency unlocked

### When to Approve Appeals

**✅ Good reasons to approve:**
- User relocated to different country (with proof)
- User traveling temporarily
- VPN/proxy false positive
- Business operating in multiple countries
- Legitimate documentation provided

**❌ Reasons to reject:**
- No valid explanation
- Attempting to avoid taxes
- Suspicious activity
- Insufficient proof
- Contradictory information

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Can't see Admin Panel menu item?

Check if your user has admin privileges:

```bash
mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017/bazario

db.users.findOne({email: "your-email@example.com"})
```

Look for:
- `email` ending with `@admin.bazario.com`, OR
- `account_type: "admin"`, OR
- `role: "admin"` or `"superadmin"`

### Update user to admin:

```bash
db.users.updateOne(
  {email: "your-email@example.com"},
  {$set: {
    account_type: "admin",
    role: "admin",
    email: "admin@admin.bazario.com"
  }}
)
```

### Currency Appeals not loading?

1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8001/api/health`
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify you're logged in as admin
4. Try refreshing the page

### Can't approve/reject appeals?

1. Verify you're using admin@admin.bazario.com email
2. Check backend logs: `tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log`
3. Ensure appeal ID is valid
4. Try adding admin notes before reviewing
