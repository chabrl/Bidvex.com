# BidVex Platform Policies & Guidelines

## Shipping vs. Local Pickup Policy

### Default Protocol: Local Pickup
**Important:** Local pickup is the standard protocol for all BidVex listings unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### How Shipping Works
- Shipping is a **premium service** offered by individual sellers
- Not all sellers offer shipping capabilities
- Each lot has independent shipping options

### How to Check Shipping Availability
**Look for the Shipping Icon:**
- Navigate to the lot detail page
- Look for the **Shipping Icon** (📦 or truck symbol)
- **Icon Present** = Seller offers shipping for this item
- **No Icon** = Local pickup only - buyer must collect in person

### Important Notes
- BidVex does not guarantee shipping on any item
- Always verify shipping options before bidding
- Shipping costs are determined by the seller
- International shipping may have additional restrictions

## Anti-Sniping Protection

### What is Anti-Sniping?
Anti-sniping is a fairness feature that prevents last-second bidding manipulation.

### How It Works
- **Trigger Window:** Final 2 minutes of auction
- **Extension:** If a bid is placed within the final 2 minutes, the auction clock extends by **120 seconds** (2 minutes) from the time of the bid
- **Unlimited Extensions:** There is no maximum limit on extensions
- **Independent Timers:** In multi-lot auctions, each lot has its own independent timer

### Why We Use It
- Ensures fair opportunity for all bidders
- Prevents "sniping" tactics
- Gives competitors time to respond
- Creates transparent bidding environment

### Example Scenario
- Auction ends at 3:00 PM
- User bids at 2:59 PM (within 2-minute window)
- New end time: 3:01 PM (2 minutes from bid time)
- If another bid comes at 3:00:30 PM
- New end time: 3:02:30 PM
