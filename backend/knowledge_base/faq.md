## Bidding Questions

**Q: How does bidding work?**
A:
1. Find item you want
2. Check current high bid
3. Enter your maximum bid amount
4. System auto-bids for you up to your max
5. Get notified if outbid
6. Win when timer reaches zero

**Q: What is proxy bidding?**
A: You set your maximum bid, and our system automatically increases your bid by the minimum increment only when needed to stay competitive. You never pay more than necessary up to your max.

**Q: Can I retract a bid?**
A: No, all bids are binding commitments. Please bid carefully and only on items you intend to purchase.

**Q: Why was my bid rejected?**
A: Common reasons:
- Bid too low (must beat current + minimum increment)
- Account not verified (phone + payment required)
- You're the seller (cannot bid on own listings)
- Buy Now disabled by admin
- Auction has ended

**Q: What does "Your bid must be at least $X.XX to lead" mean?**
A: Your bid needs to be higher than the current high bid plus the minimum bid increment to become the new leader.

**Q: Why did I get outbid immediately after bidding?**
A: Another bidder set a higher maximum bid using proxy bidding. The system automatically outbid you up to their max.

## Anti-Sniping & Timing

**Q: Why did the auction timer suddenly extend?**
A: That's our anti-sniping protection! When someone bids in the final 2 minutes, the auction extends by 2 minutes from the bid time. This ensures fair opportunity for all bidders.

**Q: How many times can the auction extend?**
A: Unlimited. As long as bids keep coming in the final 2 minutes, the auction keeps extending by 2 minutes each time.

**Q: Does extension affect all lots in multi-item auctions?**
A: No! Each lot has its own independent timer. Extension on Lot 1 does not affect Lot 2's end time.

**Q: Is there a way to prevent extensions?**
A: No, anti-sniping is a core fairness feature that cannot be disabled. It protects against last-second bidding manipulation.

**Q: What if I can't stay for extensions?**
A: Set your maximum proxy bid at your true maximum. The system will bid for you automatically during any extensions.

## Shipping & Pickup

**Q: Do you ship items?**
A: Shipping availability depends on the individual seller. **Local pickup is the default** for all items.

**Q: How do I know if shipping is available?**
A: Look for the **Shipping Icon** (📦 or truck symbol) on the lot detail page:
- **Icon Present** = Seller offers shipping
- **No Icon** = Local pickup only (buyer must collect)

**Q: Can I request shipping if there's no icon?**
A: You can contact the seller via messaging system, but they are not obligated to offer shipping. Never assume shipping is available without confirmation.

**Q: Who pays for shipping?**
A: Shipping costs are determined by the seller and typically paid by the buyer. Details are in the listing description.

**Q: Does BidVex handle shipping?**
A: No, BidVex does not ship items. Shipping arrangements are between buyer and seller. We provide the messaging platform for coordination.

**Q: What if the item arrives damaged?**
A: Contact the seller first. If unresolved, create a support ticket. Buyer protection may apply depending on circumstances.
