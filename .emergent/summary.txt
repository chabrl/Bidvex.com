The AI engineer successfully transitioned from initial platform development to focused feature enhancements and bug fixes for the BidVex platform. Key achievements include a comprehensive Multi-Lot Listing Wizard with CSV bulk upload, image drag-and-drop, and robust validation. This was followed by resolving a critical issue blocking access to individual multi-lot auction detail pages by creating the missing frontend route and component. Subsequently, significant UI/UX improvements were implemented for multi-lot listings, including a Grid/List toggle, an Image Viewer with zoom/navigation, and a Lot Index sidebar. The current work addresses a mobile navigation deficiency and has just begun implementing an auto-sliding image carousel for auction cards on the Lots Marketplace page, following a new user request.
