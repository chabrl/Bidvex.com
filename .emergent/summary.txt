The trajectory details the iterative development of the Bazario platform, later rebranded to BidVex. Initially, the AI engineer addressed critical bug fixes related to mobile navigation and My Bids dashboard UX clarity. Following this, a comprehensive Watchlist feature was implemented across the backend and frontend. The project then transitioned into Session 2, which focused on a major UX overhaul: building an animated Homepage Banner, Horizontal Carousels, simplifying the Footer, and creating a How It Works page. A significant turning point was the complete rebranding to BidVex, including logo, color scheme, global text updates, favicon, and a Grid/List toggle. During this, a critical backend syntax error causing authentication failure was identified and resolved. Finally, the remaining Phase 2 features—bidder visibility on auction pages, enhanced filtering/sorting with persistence, and social sharing integration—were completed. The work concluded with planning for Phase 3, focusing on multi-lot listing enhancements and seller automation, with the AI engineer having just started on the Multi-Lot Wizard.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently initiating **Phase 3** of the BidVex platform development, focusing on seller empowerment and automation. The immediate task is to enhance the **Multi-Lot Listing Wizard**, specifically on the  page.

This involves:
1.  **Enhancing the existing page** to be more intuitive and step-by-step.
2.  Implementing **bulk upload support** for lots, which should handle both CSV (with columns: title, description, quantity, starting\_bid, image\_urls) and drag-and-drop for multiple images (one per lot with optional matching titles).
3.  Adhering to a soft limit of **500 lots per listing**.

This work is directly in line with the user's explicit request for Phase 3 implementation, following the provided priority order (Multi-Lot Wizard -> Shipping/Rigging -> Seller Terms -> Business Verification -> PDFs -> Optional Features). The AI engineer has just begun by attempting to inspect the existing  page to understand its current structure before making modifications.
