The AI engineer successfully progressed BidVex through several critical development phases. Initial work focused on comprehensive Phase 6 Launch Readiness validation, completing all backend tests for security, infrastructure, currency enforcement, bilingual support, PDF generation, and admin panel functionality. Subsequently, a major effort was dedicated to auditing and fixing incomplete bilingual (EN/FR) translations across the entire frontend. The project then transitioned to significant Lots Auction enhancements, which involved extensive backend model updates, new API endpoints for wishlist and premium bidding features, and the creation of several new frontend components (e.g., , , , ). Finally, subscription management UI was integrated into user profiles and the admin panel, and the implementation of VIP auto-promotion logic was initiated. The current state is mid-implementation of the VIP auto-promotion feature.

<current_work>
The immediate work before this summary request involves implementing the VIP auto-promotion feature. This feature dictates that VIP users' listings are automatically  and  upon creation. The AI engineer is currently working on the backend part of this task, specifically checking the  model in  to ensure it has the necessary  and  fields to support this new logic. The next step is to add the  field if it's missing and then implement the conditional logic for VIP users during listing creation. This will complete the subscription management system and VIP promotional advantages.

<optional_next_step>
Update the  model in  to include the  field and then implement the VIP auto-promotion logic during listing creation.
