The trajectory details the iterative development of the Bazario auction platform. Initially, the AI engineer focused on core MVP features, including authentication, real-time bidding via WebSockets, and a basic React UI. Key phases included implementing a detailed Footer, Promote Listing functionality (with a modal and Stripe payments), and a Message Seller button. A significant portion of work involved building a comprehensive, multi-phase Admin Dashboard, encompassing operational control, moderation, analytics, and advanced features. The AI then integrated an AI Trust & Safety system using an Emergent LLM Key. The most recent phase began a major UX overhaul for mobile, including a sticky bottom navigation, enhanced item cards, and a My Bids dashboard. The AI is currently addressing user feedback regarding navigation redirects and My Bids dashboard UX clarity.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on a comprehensive UX overhaul (Session 1 of a 30-50 hour plan).
Specifically, the engineer implemented:
1.  **Mobile Bottom Navigation**: A new component  was created and integrated into  for mobile-friendly navigation.
2.  **Item Card Improvements**:  was updated to enhance item cards with additional seller information and trust badges.
3.  **My Bids Dashboard**:  was significantly refactored to include a tabbed interface (Winning, Losing, Watching) for tracking bids.

The user provided feedback on these implementations (Chat Message 361):
1.  **Mobile Bottom Navigation - Redirect Issue**: The Watchlist and Profile buttons redirect to blank pages, suggesting routing or component rendering issues for  and . The AI checked  and , finding the routes seemingly correct.
2.  **My Bids Dashboard - UX Clarity**: The bid cards on mobile were described as dense and lacking visual hierarchy, needing adjustments for status badges, bid comparison, countdown timers, and action buttons. The AI has started addressing this by modifying  to improve the layout for Winning, Losing, and Watching tabs.

The current work left off with the AI still in the process of improving the Watching tab empty state and add missing imports within .
