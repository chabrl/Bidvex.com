The AI engineer has progressed the BidVex application through several major feature implementations. Initially, the focus was on implementing and thoroughly testing VIP auto-promotion logic on both the backend and frontend. This included updating models, API endpoints, and adding visual cues like featured badges and sorting. Subsequently, Premium tier auto-promotion (3 days) was added, requiring backend logic updates and further frontend UI adjustments to comparison tables and tooltips. The next large feature was displaying auctioneer information, which involved creating a new backend profile summary endpoint and integrating a new frontend  component across multiple pages. The most recent sequence of tasks involved six enhancements from a new user request: removal of wishlist, updating sell button flow, adding a seller rating system, lot countdown timers, sharing/watching lots, and quantity pricing. The quick wins (wishlist removal, sell button flow) were completed. Backend aspects of seller ratings, lot countdowns, and lot watching were implemented, and  updated. The current work halted mid-implementation of the Lots Auction Homepage – 4 Filtered Rows frontend UI.
