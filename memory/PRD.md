# BidVex — Auction Marketplace PRD

## Latest: P0 Final Pre-Launch Fixes (Apr 27, 2026) — DONE

### 6/6 P0 fixes shipped (all verified by iter158 — 100% backend + frontend)
1. **Google OAuth + Profile Settings**
   - AuthPage now redirects to `https://auth.emergentagent.com` (no env-var dependency)
   - Profile page adds: read-only Email + "Change Email" button + Province dropdown (13 CA provinces/territories, bilingual)
   - New endpoints: `POST /api/auth/email-change/{request,confirm}` — Law 25 compliant double-opt-in (verification link sent to NEW email, change applied only after click, all sessions invalidated)
2. **AI Chatbot graceful fallback** — 30s hard timeout + amber "Service degraded" banner + auto-recovery on next success + email-support action button
3. **Tap-to-toggle InfoTip** — controlled state, opens on click/hover/focus, closes on outside-pointer-down (mobile-first)
   - Buyer Dashboard: 6 bilingual tooltips (header, 3 stat cards, tabs section, hint)
   - Seller Dashboard: 5 bilingual tooltips (commission rate + 4 stat cards)
4. **Image compression** — `services/image_compression.py` (Pillow 12.1) compresses base64 listing images to JPEG 800px@85% (~60-94% size reduction). Cache-Control 1y already in middleware for image extensions
5. **Farm Equipment deleted** — DB migrated (categories collection + listings + multi_item_listings + nested lots). FilterBar.js + admin_ops CFIA list updated. `/api/categories` cache invalidated.
6. **Hero stats removed** — 50K+ / 10K+ / $2M+ / 99.9% stat cards deleted (Option A: clean hero, no replacement)

### Files changed
- backend/routes/auth.py (+ email-change endpoints, asyncio import)
- backend/routes/profiles.py (province/city/postal_code added to allowed_fields + ProfileUpdate)
- backend/routes/listings.py (compress_image_list applied to single & multi-item)
- backend/routes/admin_ops.py (CFIA list cleaned)
- backend/services/image_compression.py (NEW — Pillow compression)
- backend/scripts/migrate_farm_equipment.py (NEW — one-shot migration, executed)
- frontend/src/pages/{HomePage,ProfileSettingsPage,BuyerDashboard,SellerDashboard,AuthPage}.js
- frontend/src/components/{InfoTip,AIAssistant,FilterBar/FilterBar}.js

### Tests
- iter158: 9/9 backend pass, frontend 100%, no critical/minor issues
- Test file: /app/backend/tests/test_prelaunch_fixes_158.py
